## Development Process

The project was developed using Angular, Angular Material, Express, Node.js, and flat file storage. The development followed a mobile-first approach and utilized SCSS for styling. API calls were made using RxJS. The SCSS styles followed the BEM (Block Element Modifier) and OOCSS (Object-Oriented CSS) methodologies.
